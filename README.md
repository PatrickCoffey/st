# schlerp's st

## about
This is my fork of ST, it was started form the 0.7 version of the AUR package. Currenly uses make and manual installation. Will be writing PKG build soon.

## features

  * Transparency with an x compositor (eg. xcompmgr or compton)
  * Solarized theme currently (TBC)
  * scroll support added (why the fuck would i use such a light terminal and then wait for tmux to load every time i want to use it?)
  * default font (monofur for Powerline currently) configured to be legible on a HiDPI screen (i have a 13.3 inch with 3000x1800)
  * will add more as i see fit

## todo

  * configure font size a bit more
  * work out if a broke anything allowing scroll without holding shift key (seems to be alright?)
  * remove commented code blocks when sure its all good
  * adjust color theme to Base16 Hopscotch, (write a tool to do this for me?)
