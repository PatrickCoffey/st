# schlerp's st

### about
This is my fork of ST, it was started form the 0.7 version of the AUR package. Currenly uses make and manual installation. Will be writing PKGBUILD build soon for easy use on arch, probably wont add it to aur unless someone asks for it!)

### features

  * Transparency with an x compositor (eg. xcompmgr or compton)
  * Solarized theme currently (TBC)
  * Scroll support added (why the fuck would I use such a light terminal and then wait for tmux to load every time I want to use it?)
  * Default font ("monofur for Powerline" currently) configured to be legible on a HiDPI screen (I have a 13.3 inch with 3000x1800)
  * Will add more as I see fit, after all isnt that the beauty of st!?!

### todo

  * Configure font size a bit more
  * Work out if a broke anything allowing scroll without holding shift key (seems to be alright?)
  * Remove commented code blocks when sure its all good
  * Adjust color theme to Base16 Hopscotch, (write a tool to do this for me?)
